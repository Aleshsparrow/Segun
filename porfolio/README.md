## About

This is a web app to provide potential clients and/or employers with my personal contact information, showcase some of the projects I've worked on and also give insight on the technologies I have experience working with.

## Design

The web app was built with react, the main layout was designed using Bootsrap rows and columns through react-strap NPM package.

The application was also optimized for different screen sizes using rows and column layout through react-strap

- I used Fontawesome for the icons and used Google fonts for the fonts.

- The animations on the Home page and the Projects page were done with pure CSS animations.

- The images were hosted on imgur.

- The title icon was designed with Canva.

- Netlify was used to deploy the site.
